# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Game using Python
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python!  I created a Rock Paper Scissors game. It asks you if you want to play, takes your input, compares it with the random computer input, gives you the outcome, and then asks if you want to play again.

## Requirements
- Python 3 or better
- Code editor or IDE Tools

## How to play?
If the program asks you, "Would you like to play Rock, Paper, Scissors?"
You have two options:
- Type "Yes"
 - if you want to play the game!
- Type "No"
 - If you want to quit the game!
